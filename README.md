# cra-template-near

This is a minimal NEAR template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using TypeScript.

To use this template, add `--template @ahalabs` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-near-app --template @ahalabs
```
or
```
yarn create react-app my-near-app --template @ahalabs
```

- [User Guide](https://create-react-app.dev) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

For a (possibly unmaintained) NEAR template that has a more opinionated approach about abstracting NEAR functionality to external hooks & libraries, see [mehtaphysical/cra-template-near](https://github.com/mehtaphysical/near-js/tree/main/packages/cra-template-near) which can be used with `--template near`.
